# Code-in-your-plate

I had a lot of fun with the "Code in your plate". Creating web pages has always been something that I have been interested in and during this project I was able to revisit CSS and touch up on my skills. 

There's only so much you can do with a recipe when it comes to styling. I made a very simplistic design, using a green background to add some life to the page. I ensured that my recipe was responsive so that it can easily be viewed on all types of devices, big or small. This was one of the things that I weren't completely confident on prior to the project. 

I had always never really known how to make a responsive page, which is really important as most people - including myself use their mobile phones to browse the web.
